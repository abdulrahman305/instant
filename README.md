# instant.dev ![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/instant-dev/orm.svg?branch=main)

## Rails-inspired JavaScript ORM and Migrations for Postgres

[**instant.dev**](https://instant.dev) provides a fast, reliable, and heavily
battle-tested Object-Relational Mapper and Migration Management system for
Postgres 13+ built in JavaScript. For those familiar with Ruby on Rails, you can
think of instant.dev like ActiveRecord for the Node.js, Deno and Bun ecosystems.
Weâ€™ve been using it since 2016 in production at [Autocode](https://autocode.com)
where it has managed over 1 billion records in a 4TB AWS Aurora Postgres
instance.

You can add instant.dev to any existing JavaScript project or use it to
scaffold a new Postgres-backed API project from scratch. It works out of the box
with any PostgreSQL provider: AWS RDS, Railway, Vercel Postgres, Neon, Supabase.

## Features

1. **CRUD operations**: Create, Read, Update and Destroy records easily.

2. **Query composition**: Build complex SELECT and UPDATE queries with many
   layers of nested joins and conditional statements.

3. **Transactions**: Ensure data consistency within logical transaction blocks
   that can be rolled back to prevent writing orphaned data.

4. **Input validation**: Synchronously validate object fields to ensure the
   right data is being stored.

5. **Relationship verification**: Asynchronously validate relationships between
   one or more fields and external resources before saving.

6. **Calculated fields**: Automatically populate object fields based on existing
   data.

7. **Lifecycle callbacks**: Execute custom logic beforeSave(), afterSave(),
   beforeDestroy() and afterDestroy() to perform necessary build and teardown
   steps inside of transactions.

8. **Migrations**: Manage local database state via the filesystem to make
   branched git development a breeze.

9. **Seeding**: Provide custom JSON files so that all developers can share the
   same test data across development, testing and staging environments.

10. **Code generation**: Automatically generate models, migrations and endpoints
    for your project.

# Installation and Usage

```shell
$ npm i instant.dev -g
$ cd ~/projects/my-awesome-project
$ instant init
```

That's it! The command line tool will walk you through the process of
initializing your instant.dev project. It will;

- Automatically detect whether this is a new project or an existing one
- Scaffold a new [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or [Autocode](https://autocode.com)
  project, if necessary
- Ask for your local database credentials
- Initialize necessary files in the `_instant/` directory of your project
- Create an initial migration

# Installing kits

If you're getting started from scratch and want a working project right away,
instant.dev comes with **kits**: sets of models and their corresponding
migrations that add complex functionality to your app without having to figure
it all out yourself.

If you're starting a new project from scratch, instant.dev comes with **kits**:
sets of models and their corresponding migrations that add complex functionality
to your app without having to figure it all out yourself.

Right now the only available kit is:

```shell
$ instant kit auth
```

Which creates a `User` and `AccessToken` model, as well as corresponding
endpoints, that can be used to register and log in users. We'll be adding more
and welcome contributions!

## Using the `instant` command line utility

You can look up documentation for the `instant` command line utility at any
point by running `instant` or `instant help`. The most commonly used methods
are:

- `instant g:model` to create a new model
- `instant g:relationship` to create one-to-one or one-to-many relationships
  between models
- `instant g:endpoint` to automatically scaffold Vercel or Autocode endpoints,
  if applicable
- `instant db:migrate` to run migrations
- `instant db:rollback` to rollback migrations
- `instant db:rollbackSync` to rollback to last synchronized (filesystem x
  database) migration
- `instant db:bootstrap` to reset your database, run migrations, and seed data
- `instant db:add` to add remote databases (AWS RDS, Railway, Vercel Postgres,
  Neon, Supabase)
- `instant serve` to run your server using Vercel, Autocode or the command
  specified in `package.json["scripts"]["start"]`
- `instant deploy` to run outstanding migrations and deploy to Vercel or
  Autocode

## Using the Instant ORM

```javascript
const Instant = require('@instant.dev/orm')();

// Connect to your database
// Defaults to using instant/db.json[process.env.NODE_ENV || 'local']
await Instant.connect();

// Get the user model: can also use 'user', 'users' to same effect
const User = Instant.Model('User');

// Create a user
let user = await User.create({username: 'Billy'});

// log user JSON
// {id: 1, username: 'Billy', created_at: '...', updated_at: '...'}
console.log(user.toJSON());

let user2 = await User.create({username: 'Sharon'});
let user3 = await User.create({username: 'William'});
let user4 = await User.create({username: 'Jill'});

// Retrieves users with username containing the string 'ill'
let users = await User.query()
  .where({username__icontains: 'ill'})
  .orderBy('username', 'ASC')
  .select();

// [{username: 'Billy'}, {username: 'Jill'}, {username: 'William'}]
console.log(users.toJSON());
```

Full documentation for the ORM can be found in the
[@instant.dev/orm](https://github.com/instant-dev/orm) repository.

# Installing kits

## auth

To install the "auth" kit, which contains a **User** and **AccessToken**
model and provides authentication into a web API via the `Authorization` header:

```shell
$ instant kit auth
```

### Signing up a user

```shell
$ curl localhost:3000/api/users --data \
  "email=keith@instant.dev&password=mypass&repeat_password=mypass"
```

Should give you:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "email": "keith@instant.dev",
  "created_at": "2023-09-18T22:46:44.866Z",
  "updated_at": "2023-09-18T22:46:44.940Z"
}
```

### Logging in a user

```shell
$ curl localhost:3000/api/auth --data \
  "username=keith@instant.dev&password=mypass&grant_type=password"
```

Should give you;

```json
{
  "key": "secret_development_K7neQjsdnM2etQ1naPrTFqRMgJWwppvzrbbWefipib4Sqex6hmPrrqvYdczQ7vbp",
  "ip_address": "::ffff:127.0.0.1",
  "user_agent": "curl/7.79.1",
  "expires_at": "2023-10-18T22:53:36.967Z",
  "is_valid": true,
  "created_at": "2023-09-18T22:53:36.967Z",
  "updated_at": "2023-09-18T22:53:36.967Z",
}
```

### Seeing your own user data

```shell
$ curl localhost:3000/api/users/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer secret_development_K7neQjsdnM2etQ1naPrTFqRMgJWwppvzrbbWefipib4Sqex6hmPrrqvYdczQ7vbp"
```

Should give you;

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "email": "keith@instant.dev",
  "created_at": "2023-09-18T22:46:44.866Z",
  "updated_at": "2023-09-18T22:46:44.940Z"
}
```

### Seeing a list of all users

```shell
