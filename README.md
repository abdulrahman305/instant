# instant.dev ![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/instant-dev/orm.svg?branch=main)

## Rails-inspired JavaScript ORM and Migrations for Postgres

[**instant.dev**](https://instant.dev) provides a fast, reliable, and
battle-tested ORM and migration management system for Postgres 13+ built in
JavaScript. For those familiar with Ruby on Rails, you can think of instant.dev
like ActiveRecord for the Node.js, Deno and Bun ecosystems. Weâ€™ve been using it
since 2016 in production at [Autocode](https://autocode.com) where it has
managed over 1 billion records in a 4TB AWS Aurora Postgres instance.

Use instant.dev to:

- Add the [Instant ORM](https://githib.com/instant-dev/orm) and migrations to
  your existing JavaScript project
- Scaffold new Postgres-backed API projects from scratch using
  [Autocode](https://autocode.com) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- Generate new migrations, models and endpoints
- Migrate remote databases and deploy in a single step
- Connect to any PostgreSQL host: AWS RDS, Railway, Vercel Postgres, Neon,
  Supabase

## Features

1. **CRUD operations**: Create, Read, Update and Destroy records easily.

2. **Query composition**: Build complex SELECT and UPDATE queries with many
   layers of nested joins and conditional statements.

3. **Transactions**: Ensure data consistency within logical transaction blocks
   that can be rolled back to prevent writing orphaned data.

4. **Input validation**: Synchronously validate object fields to ensure the
   right data is being stored.

5. **Relationship verification**: Asynchronously validate relationships between
   one or more fields and external resources before saving.

6. **Calculated fields**: Automatically populate object fields based on existing
   data.

7. **Lifecycle callbacks**: Execute custom logic beforeSave(), afterSave(),
   beforeDestroy() and afterDestroy() to perform necessary build and teardown
   steps inside of transactions.

8. **Migrations**: Manage local database state via the filesystem to make
   branched git development a breeze.

9. **Seeding**: Provide custom JSON files so that all developers can share the
   same test data across development, testing and staging environments.

10. **Code generation**: Automatically generate models, migrations and endpoints
    for your project.

## Installation and Usage

```shell
npm i instant.dev -g
cd ~/projects/my-awesome-project
instant init
```

That's it! The command line tool will walk you through the process of
initializing your instant.dev project. It will;

- Automatically detect whether this is a new project or an existing one
- Scaffold a new [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or [Autocode](https://autocode.com)
  project, if necessary
- Ask for your local database credentials
- Initialize necessary files in the `_instant/` directory of your project
- Create an initial migration

## Getting started

If you're getting started from scratch and want a working project right away,
instant.dev comes with **kits**: sets of models and their corresponding
migrations that add complex functionality to your app without having to figure
it all out yourself.

To install the basic `auth` kit which comes with a `User` and `AccessToken`
model and associated user registration and login endpoints, use:

```shell
instant kit auth
```

You can read more in [Kits: auth](#kits-auth)

## Using `instant`

You can look up documentation for the `instant` command line utility at any
point by running `instant` or `instant help`. The most commonly used methods
are:

- `instant g:model` to create a new model
- `instant g:relationship` to create one-to-one or one-to-many relationships
  between models
- `instant g:endpoint` to automatically scaffold Vercel or Autocode endpoints,
  if applicable
- `instant db:migrate` to run migrations
- `instant db:rollback` to rollback migrations
- `instant db:rollbackSync` to rollback to last synchronized (filesystem x
  database) migration
- `instant db:bootstrap` to reset your database, run migrations, and seed data
- `instant db:add` to add remote databases (AWS RDS, Railway, Vercel Postgres,
  Neon, Supabase)
- `instant serve` to run your server using Vercel, Autocode or the command
  specified in `package.json["scripts"]["start"]`
- `instant sql` is a shortcut to `psql` in to any of your databases
- `instant deploy` to run outstanding migrations and deploy to Vercel or
  Autocode

## Using the Instant ORM

Full documentation for the ORM can be found in the
[@instant.dev/orm](https://github.com/instant-dev/orm) repository. Here is a
quick example of how you can use the Instant ORM.

```javascript
const Instant = require('@instant.dev/orm')();

// Connect to your database
// Defaults to using instant/db.json[process.env.NODE_ENV || 'local']
await Instant.connect();

// Get the user model: can also use 'user', 'users' to same effect
const User = Instant.Model('User');

// Create a user
let user = await User.create({username: 'Billy'});

// log user JSON
// {id: 1, username: 'Billy', created_at: '...', updated_at: '...'}
console.log(user.toJSON());

let user2 = await User.create({username: 'Sharon'});
let user3 = await User.create({username: 'William'});
let user4 = await User.create({username: 'Jill'});

// Retrieves users with username containing the string 'ill'
let users = await User.query()
  .where({username__icontains: 'ill'})
  .orderBy('username', 'ASC')
  .select();

// [{username: 'Billy'}, {username: 'Jill'}, {username: 'William'}]
console.log(users.toJSON());
```

## Kits

Kits provide an easy way to add complex functionality to your instant.dev apps
without having to write code from scratch. Currently kits support development
using [Autocode](https://autocode.com/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

Note that the [Autocode CLI](https://github.com/acode/cli) comes packaged with
its own HTTP wrapper, where `lib .fn.name` will call `/fn/name` on the service
with a POST request. The `-a` option is shorthand for providing an
`Authorization: Bearer` header.

### Kit: auth

```shell
instant kit auth
```

Creates a `User` and `AccessToken` model, as well as corresponding
endpoints.
